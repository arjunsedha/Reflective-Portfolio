## Week 2

### What have I learnt this week?
This week I dived into the world of system change, following my own research using the pre work readings as guidance and through the workshop that accommodated interesting conversations about the entire world as a system. This then taught me the value in systems thinking as it gives rise to a whole new perspective present on every aspect of my daily living. 
### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
Now I understand to some degree how system thinking is viewed in the world and what the processes are that implement systems change and the power of systems change. Including the different types of system categories which aid in understanding systems on a different level.
### What insights have I gained?
To view every system not as the amalgamation of it's elements, but as a structured body with purpose. This insight opens perspectives for systems change as the system's value is not in it's parts but purpose.
### What are (my/the) percieved stregnths and weaknesses that I have observed?
I have found systems change and systems thinking to be quite interesting and enjoyable; thus, it has been relatively easy to read and continue self-research on the subject. However when it came to explaning these ideas to other people I have found it quite difficult as these ideas are abstract and need thorough explanation. I beleive a weakness of mine would be in how I present system information and analysis.  
### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
The biggest challenge of this first week for IHCCS has been in learning the format of the education. Being somone who is new to Github and other resources provided I am trying to develop an understanding of all the provided information in the hope of generating a workflow that is cohesive with the learning enviournment of this subject.
### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
For the next week I would like to continue all preceding reading readings assigned and be more punctual when it comes to class discussion boards.

### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
As of now, all theory has been very broad, yet the ideas of system change and innovation have envoked a profound perspective on the course that humanity has taken upon the world. With problems ranging from slow transport to world economy imbalance, each aspect of our reality can be viewed through the lens of a systems thinker. Hence the idea that systems can be remodelled, I like to believe, may bring forth an innovation in the human psyche like no other.

## Week 3

### What have I learnt this week?
The large volume of models and perspectives on Many Model thinking. The importance of understanding the the contents of a model to the core and how to apply the model to different situaitions within industries. Th market value of model thinking. However more specifically we thought on the personal aspect of model thinking, narrowing down the scope of models to the individual to better understand and thus be able to concoct more potent models that better understand situations and people. 
### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
The differnt 'categories' of thought processes that are applied to all mindsets whrn making decisions of any kind. What exactly are the boundaries between our Rationale, Behaviour, Assumptions, Habits etc. 
### What insights have I gained?
The examples of how these differring mindsets play a role on the market, thus making providing different projections of what may be to come when predicting certain outcomes from given instances.
### What are (my/the) percieved stregnths and weaknesses that I have observed?
I believe I am able to comprehend, visualise and deconstruct the information to form my own analysis. However, the sometimes explaining the same content to others may prove challenging as I belive not enough time has been spent trying to thoroughly understand these topics in depth. Instead enough to make them feel understood, and analytically satisfying
### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
The amount of redaing required to understand these concepts was quite legnthy, including all of the other readings present in my schedule that ended up hurting my eyes. Hence I decided to download a webpage reader so i can focus on making my own notes while listening to the reader cover the entire page in minutes.
### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
Perhaps ask more questions regarding the examples in workshops so I remember what response I get to then jog my memory on the concept itself. 
### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
All theories have been proved useful as they are personal. thus each can be applied to individuals in any scenario.

## Week 4

### What have I learnt this week?
How elements within a system interact with each other, affecting the output of the system.
### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
how to visually analyse system data, and how to visualise this data to create graphs that allocate significance to different aspects of a system
### What insights have I gained?
that I need to know how to model and how to understand models, otherwise communicating systemic thinking will be difficult
### What are (my/the) percieved stregnths and weaknesses that I have observed?
streghts, understanding a model, weakness, making a model
### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
well we had strong communication within the team but trying to share diagrams was a bit of a hassle since i was drawing digitally(which shoud help) but on another device. if only i could join the meeting with both devices. 
### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
ask more questions on the how exactly the models function to understand them
### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
the theory of modelling has enabeled a much broader thinking spectrum where the scale of thought is dynamic with the system's purpose. I have nt designed any systems, but i am begining to see the different systems around me. 

## Week 5
### What have I learnt this week?
The relation between probability distribution analysis an system thinking
### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
how specific types of probability distribution graphs describe a multitude of scenarios. 
### What insights have I gained?
how the process of statistical analysis is one that provides a quantitative tool for system thinking.  
### What are (my/the) percieved stregnths and weaknesses that I have observed?
I have stutied this aspect of statistic previously thus understanding probability distributions was not too dificult. However, recalling specific examples will prove to be a challenge as there is a lot of information in this wee's study. 
### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
some challenges encoutered are actually related to the assignment instead of this week's lesson. It is translation of this information into knowledge that can be used for my own purposes that I am yet to fully accompliish. Yet there is improvement as trying to build my own examples for each phenomena proves an efficient way to achieve this goal.
### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
perhaps review each lesson's canvas pages 3 times a week. Hence not to forget the information and aid in building knowledge. 
### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
All the different interactions the concept of the normal distribution has between the different fields of thought.

## Week 6
### What have I learnt this week?
The power of abstraction in relation to concetual modelling
### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
How unintuitive systems thinking is by nature. Since we are the fish in the bowl, it becomes difficult to conceptualise our enviornment. 
### What insights have I gained?
For starters Im reconsidering switching to the DVORAK or colemak keyboard layout. Other than that, the main take away's from this week's lessons is existent integration of the progression in chance and our underlying norms as an effect of underappreciated factors of consideration. 
### What are (my/the) percieved stregnths and weaknesses that I have observed?
being clear haha. I speak often too specific or vague and without good examples that it becomes hard to understand what im saying. 
### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
trying to communcate abstract ideas. It's always a challenge, however amplified under a time limit
### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
derive some of the formulae to then better understand their applications. and maybe talk slower to be more clear. 
### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
overall, its the application of mathimatical thinking to system thinking. but specifically the cobb douglas growth model, it as it's fairly understandable and applicable to almost all industries.
