## Week 2

### What have I learnt this week?
This week I dived into the world of system change, following my own research using the pre work readings as guidance and through the workshop that accommodated interesting conversations about the entire world as a system. This then taught me the value in systems thinking as it gives rise to a whole new perspective present on every aspect of my daily living. 
### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
Now I understand to some degree how system thinking is viewed in the world and what the processes are that implement systems change and the power of systems change. Including the different types of system categories which aid in understanding systems on a different level.
### What insights have I gained?
To view every system not as the amalgamation of it's elements, but as a structured body with purpose. This insight opens perspectives for systems change as the system's value is not in it's parts but purpose.
### What are (my/the) percieved stregnths and weaknesses that I have observed?
I have found systems change and systems thinking to be quite interesting and enjoyable; thus, it has been relatively easy to read and continue self-research on the subject. However when it came to explaning these ideas to other people I have found it quite difficult as these ideas are abstract and need thorough explanation. I beleive a weakness of mine would be in how I present system information and analysis.  
### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
The biggest challenge of this first week for IHCCS has been in learning the format of the education. Being somone who is new to Github and other resources provided I am trying to develop an understanding of all the provided information in the hope of generating a workflow that is cohesive with the learning enviournment of this subject.
### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
For the next week I would like to continue all preceding reading readings assigned and be more punctual when it comes to class discussion boards.

### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
As of now, all theory has been very broad, yet the ideas of system change and innovation have envoked a profound perspective on the course that humanity has taken upon the world. With problems ranging from slow transport to world economy imbalance, each aspect of our reality can be viewed through the lens of a systems thinker. Hence the idea that systems can be remodelled, I like to believe, may bring forth an innovation in the human psyche like no other.
