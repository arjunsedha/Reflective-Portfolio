# Reflection
## Your contribution to the project

Generating the three base models that were used in the approach to build a better understanding of vaccine distribution.

Going through the super intense process of attempting to create a python code simulation and extract a visual as result for the traversal graph. The entire covid graph file.

## Other member contributions

other members covered all the other sections and though sam was unable to help past the initial draft submission, he did a great job of managing section 2 of the assignment

## What positives do you take from this project? What did you learn from this project?    

That building an understanding for a problem or issue is oddly satisfyng. To have something that you can build on as a thinking maachine and then present, discuss and learn new things from practial contribution is oddly satisfing.

## What challenges did you face in this project and how you overcame those?

prototyping a simulation. Extreamly difficult

## If you are faced with dealing with a real-worldproblem and need to do some modelling, how would you determine which modelling approach to take. 
The approach would be very similar to the one taken in this assgnment. First to build 3 if not more models that deal with different aspects of the issue. then prototype each model into a functioning perhaps dynamic one. Run these and analys outcomes. then combine these outcomes and integrate thde solution into the 'real world'.
